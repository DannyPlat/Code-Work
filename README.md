HELLO!!
Some of my friends and comp-sci buddies suggested I upload ALL my projects and pieces of code to github while I study coding, so here I am. I am a grade 11 student, studying computer science in Canada, 
and I hope to develop a career in computer science (specifically math related stuff) in the future!
